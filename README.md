# immunometabolic_gatekeeping
This repository contains data analysis supporting the manuscript: "Immunometabolic Gatekeeping: How Tissue Metabolism Conditions Tumor Immunity" - February 2026.
Each folder from /main contains scripts + input files in order to regenerate analyses shown in the manuscript. Comments within the script elucidate further rationale behind analysis that could not be covered in the paper.

Note that this repository was initially built for data analysis code and computational models underlying the ArXiv preprint: “Immunometabolic Gatekeeping: Reconciling Peto’s and the T Cell Infiltration Prognostic Paradox” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20883), and thus contains some additional folders and analyses explored in the preprint but not in the publication.
